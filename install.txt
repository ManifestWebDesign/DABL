generate.php
Point your brower to http://yourwebsite.com/your-base-url/generate.php.  if you have no base-url, it will be something like http://yourwebsite.com/generate.php.  You can generate models, views or controllers.  Other than the base models and schema.xml file, this script will ignore any files that already exist.  If you want to regenerate views or controllers that already exist, you'll need to delete or rename those files before running generate.php.
